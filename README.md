# Discussion baby reddit

This is a forum web page, a project similar to Reddit, where you may create Topics, inside each Topic you are able to create a lot of Posts and each Post can recieve different amount of Comments.
Each Comment can be replied as well.

Though UI is quite simple, the real challenge is logical.
